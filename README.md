## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

For this project, our topic will be analyzing historical data on both Ethereum and the NASDAQ index, and seeing if we can use movements in one of these datasets to predict movements in the other. Our interest lies in financial markets, cryptocurrencies and using these exchanges to build accumulation of wealth. As being "financially literate" is becoming more and more important in today's age, we wanted to analyze trends to find where the popularity lies within these asset classes. Financial markets are sometimes considered a gamble when it comes time to investing in them, especially for those who are new to the markets, so we wanted to establish hard, concrete data to cement the idea that invesitng in the markets will drive the growht of wealth for individuals invested in these markers. Typically, as crypto markets are still fairly new and there no easy ways to deine crypto markets, we wanted to take a look and see if there are any correlations between crypto markets and markets of other asset claseese, such as equity markets.
