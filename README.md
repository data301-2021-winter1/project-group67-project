## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

For this project, our topic will be analyzing historical data on both Ethereum and the NASDAQ index, and seeing if we can use movements in one of these datasets to predict movements in the other. Our interest lies in financial markets, cryptocurrencies and using these exchanges to build accumulation of wealth. As being "financially literate" is becoming more and more important in today's age, we wanted to analyze trends to find where the popularity lies between these asset classes. Financial markets are sometimes considered a gamble when it comes time to investing in them, especially for those who are new to the markets, so we wanted to establish hard, concrete data to cement the idea that investing in the markets will drive the growth of wealth for individuals invested in these markets. Typically, as crypto markets are still fairly new and there no easy ways to deine crypto markets, we wanted to take a look and see if there are any correlations between crypto markets and markets of other asset claseese, such as equity markets. 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

We have two different datasets: one on historical Ethereum prices, and one on historical NASDAQ prices.

In our datasets, we have every day's opening price, closing price, high, low, and volume for both ethereum and the NASDAQ composite, all over the last two years. Both datasets are measured using the American dollar, to keep consistency between the two.

We are fetching both datasets from Yahoo Finance. Since we are using Yahoo Finance, they publish data available to access for the general public, however we are not able to reupload and redistribute this data under our name. The data is comprehensive and complete, and provides users with useful information on the markets.

Even though they are on different asset classes, both datasets have identical metrics, making them far easier to compare. We will be able to compare them in relation to each other, and can be assured that we have minimized external variables. Comparing the performance of them will be attainable due to being able to analzye this data without many prohibiting factors.
